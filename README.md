# Zen-Maker-Lab
Unity Project Kit

This repository will contain all C# project files and template files for the Zen Maker Lab Unity project kit -- development of a 2D platformer. 

Note: when using template scripts, the class name needs to match the script name for proper functionality. This must be done manually as the file names of template scripts will always end with "Template". Best practice is to use template scripts for practice, and ensure that final script matches source script.
