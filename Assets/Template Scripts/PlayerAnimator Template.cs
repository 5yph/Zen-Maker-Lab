           Hint: rb.velocity.y gives you info about the velocity in the y direction.
           
           Check if our player is jumping (or is just getting launched into the air).
           Check if the player is falling.
           Check if neither is the case.
        
           We want to keep track of two booleans: "Jumping" and "Falling", 
           in the same manner as the above if-else statement. It is up to you to figure
           out in which cases these booleans are set to true and false.

        // Check if our player is shooting (optional). If so, set the "Shooting" boolean.
        // Hint: Something in our 'shooter' objects gives us info about if our player is shooting.

        // TASK #4

        // Check if our player is dead. If so, set the "Dead" boolean.
        // Hint: Something in our 'damage' objects gives us info about if our player is dead.
