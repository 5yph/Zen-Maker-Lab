        Find a method to automatically instantiate our volText object at runtime.

        Hints: 
        - 'this' keyword always references our current game object. If we attached this script
        to the volume text game object, it would refer to that volume text object.
        - 'GetComponent<COMPONENT>()' is a method of every game object, include 'this'.
        - 'GetComponent<COMPONENT>()' returns COMPONENT, we can return our TextMeshProUGUI component

        a very long float (decimal) number, which we don't like. Try using Round() from the Mathf 
        class to combat this.
